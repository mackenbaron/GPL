 * \brief API interface test is in charge of path management
 *
 * It provides APIs to query path list and to query properties for a specific path.
 *
 * \note
 * This interface requirs to run in main loop thread because some GLib dependency.
 *
 * Besides, you should keep main loop idle for most of times in order to get callbacks and make sure
 * libtest-api process signals successfully. This means you should put business logic into a separate
 * thread.
